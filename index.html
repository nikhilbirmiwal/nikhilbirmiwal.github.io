<p>Welcome to my personal website.</p>
<p>Stuff I&#39;m interested in:</p>
<ul>

      Databases: I never took any courses in college, but better late than
      never. Thankfully, CMU&#39;s DB course is
      <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/">open sourced</a>. Rather than
      writing in CPP, however, I figured I should port some of the labs into
      Rust - two birds with one stone.

        Especially K8s. I&#39;m reading up on

          >K8s, Up and Running by O&#39;Reilly</a
        >, recommended by a colleague.

        I intend on going over first principles. CMU offers some [good
        courses](https://www.composablesystems.org/15-440/fa2022/).

      Cloud Architecture AWS has some certifications which seem to broad-stroke
      explain how cloud solutions work. I&#39;m slowly pursuing a cert, although
      admittedly I&#39;m not too keen on test-taking. I suspect there will be
      enough breadth to explore while studying, though.

      Poker: It&#39;s a fascinating game, and there&#39;s some pretty
      interesting algorithms that go alongside it. I&#39;m writing a
      <a href="https://github.com/nikhilbirmiwal/pokerbot">Poker Bot</a>
      inspired by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00164">CMU paper</a>,
