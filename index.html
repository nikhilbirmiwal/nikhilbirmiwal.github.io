<p>Welcome to my personal website.</p>
<p>Stuff I&#39;m interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Databases:
I never took any courses in college, but better late than never. Thankfully, CMU&#39;s DB course is <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/">open sourced</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Distributed Systems:
Especially K8s. I&#39;m reading up on <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781491935668/">K8s, Up and Running by O&#39;Reilly</a>, recommended by a colleague.
I intend on going over first principles by reimplementing <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> -- it&#39;s been a while since undergrad.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cloud Architecture
AWS has some certifications which seem to broad-stroke explain how cloud solutions work. I&#39;m slowly pursuing a cert, although admittedly I&#39;m not too keen on test-taking.
I suspect there will be enough breadth to explore while studying, though.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Poker:
It&#39;s a fascinating game, and there&#39;s some pretty interesting algorithms that go alongside it. I&#39;m writing a <a href="https://github.com/nikhilbirmiwal/pokerbot">Poker Bot</a> inspired by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00164">CMU paper</a>,
&quot;index.html&quot; 22L, 1203B</p>
</li>
</ul>
