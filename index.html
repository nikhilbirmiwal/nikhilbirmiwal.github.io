Welcome to my personal website. 

Stuff I'm interested in:
- Databases:
I never took any courses in college, but better late than never. Thankfully, CMU's DB course is [open sourced](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/).

- Distributed Systems:
Especially K8s. I'm reading up on [K8s, Up and Running by O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781491935668/), recommended by a colleague.
I intend on going over first principles by reimplementing [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) -- it's been a while since undergrad.
 
- Cloud Architecture
AWS has some certifications which seem to broad-stroke explain how cloud solutions work. I'm slowly pursuing a cert, although admittedly I'm not too keen on test-taking. 
I suspect there will be enough breadth to explore while studying, though. 

- Poker:
It's a fascinating game, and there's some pretty interesting algorithms that go alongside it. I'm writing a [Poker Bot](https://github.com/nikhilbirmiwal/pokerbot) inspired by a [CMU paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00164), 
and hope to eventually port it to the cloud using some of the learnings from above.


Professional Experience:
