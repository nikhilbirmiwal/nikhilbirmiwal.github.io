<p>Welcome to my personal website.</p>
<p>Stuff I&#39;m interested in:</p>
<p>
  Distributed Systems:
  <li>
    There's a plethora of good courses online. I'm working through
    <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html">MIT's</a>, for
    example.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#39;m reading up on
    <a
      href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781491935668/"
      >K8s, Up and Running by O&#39;Reilly</a
    >, recommended by a colleague.
  </li>
</p>

<p>
  I'm primarily focused on the above. I have some half-baked endeavors in the
  concepts below.

<p>
  Databases: I never took any courses in college, but better late than never.
  Thankfully, CMU&#39;s DB course is
  <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/">open sourced</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Cloud Architecture AWS has some certifications which seem to broad-stroke
  explain how cloud solutions work. I&#39;m slowly pursuing a cert, although
  admittedly I&#39;m not too keen on test-taking. I suspect there will be enough
  breadth to explore while studying, though.

  Poker: It&#39;s a fascinating game, and there&#39;s some pretty interesting
  algorithms that go alongside it. I&#39;m writing a
  <a href="https://github.com/nikhilbirmiwal/pokerbot">Poker Bot</a>
  inspired by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00164">CMU paper</a>,
